## About

I followed [this post](https://blog.floydhub.com/a-beginners-guide-on-recurrent-neural-networks-with-pytorch/) to better understand and implement the network. The notes I made about Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are available [here](/documentation/rnn-notes.png).

The code is also almost entirely copied from the post.
